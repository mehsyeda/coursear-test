                    Butter chicken like chicken tikka masala, is one of the most popular Indian curries across the world and for all the right reasons. This delicious chicken recipe is also popular by its Hindi name - murgh makhani. The taste of the creamy bright coloured masala with chunks of grilled chicken in it is an unforgettable one.
